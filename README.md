How Can I Help?
================
You can:
* Rewrite RequestInjectionTest to use a HTTP client library. Some good options would be apache's http-client, RestEasy's client framework, or the JAX-RS 2.0 client api.
* Write the Producer for HttpServletResponse, including test(s).
* Clean up pom.xml. Sorry it's a mess!
